# Hi, I'm Nahom 👋

I'm a PhD candidate in Nuclear Engineering working on
modeling and simulation of fusion/fission reactors, with a focus on:

- Compressible flow and shock physics
- Multi-physics simulation (CFD, conjugate heat transfer, ablation)
- AI-assisted workflows

🔬 Interests

💥 Inertial Fusion Energy (IFE) chamber dynamics
🌊 CFD for compressible and incompressible flows
🔥 Conjugate heat transfer
⚛️ Neutronics (Serpent & OpenMC)
🤖 AI-assisted modeling
